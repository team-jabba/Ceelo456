            <h2>
                Rules of Cee-lo:
            </h2>
            <p>
                One player is the banker while the other player bets against the banker.
            </p>
            <h2>
                The banker rolls the dice:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Automatic Wins: 

                If the banker rolls 4-5-6, "triples" (all three dice show the same number), 
                or a pair (of non-6s) with a 6 then they instantly win.
            </p>
            <p>
                Automatic Losses: 
                If the banker rolls 1-2-3, or a pair (of non-1s) with a 1, they instantly lose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Set Point: 

                If the banker rolls a pair and a single (2, 3, 4, or 5), then the single becomes 
                the banker's "point." For example: a roll of 2-2-4 gives the banker a point of 4. 
                Note that you can not set a point of 1 or 6, as those would result in an automatic 
                loss or win, respectively (see above).
            </p>
            <p>
                Re-roll: 

                If the dice don't show any of the above combinations, then the banker rolls again 
                and keeps rolling until they get an instant win or an instant loss, or sets a point.
            </p>
            <h2>
                The player rolls the dice:
            </h2>
            <p>
                If the banker does not roll an automatic win or loss, they will have rolled a point 
                of 2, 3, 4, or 5. The player then rolls the dice to settle their bet against the banker. 
                The player wins with a 4-5-6, triple, or any point higher than the Banker's. They lose 
                with a 1-2-3, or any point lower than the banker's. If they tie the banker's point, then 
                it's a "push", no winner or loser, and the player pockets their stake.
